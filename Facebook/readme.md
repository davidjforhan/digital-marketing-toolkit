# Facebook ads

## ye olde 20 percent rule
Facebook's 20% rule is dead (but not really). Images with more than 20% text will be marked as 'text-heavy' and the quality score will suffer. This means you can still use the ad tile but it will cost more to reach your audience.

New guidance on the low/medium/high ratings can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/business/help/980593475366490

My facebook psd tempalte still has the 5x5 grid for now, so you can make a generalization of the amount of text in your image. When more guidance is available I will update.

## image resource

https://unsplash.com/ is a nice resource for free images. I used a few as placeholders in the templates.
